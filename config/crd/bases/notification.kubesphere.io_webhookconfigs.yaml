                resolved via external DNS in some api servers (e.g., `kube-apiserver`
                cannot resolve in-cluster DNS as that would be a layering violation).

                or `127.0.0.1` as a `host` is risky unless you take great care to
                run this webhook on all hosts which run an apiserver which might need
                to make calls to this webhook. Such installs are likely to be non-portable,

                and if present may be any string permissible in a URL. You may use
                the path to pass an arbitrary string to the webhook, for example,
                a cluster identifier. \n Attempting to use a user or basic auth e.g.
                \"user:password@\" is not allowed. Fragments (\"#...\") and query
                parameters (\"?...\") are not allowed, either."
